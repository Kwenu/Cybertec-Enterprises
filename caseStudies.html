              Commenting on the agreement
              signed with SLT, Mr. Mano Wickramanayake, Group Director of
              MTV/MBC said; “I am greatly appreciative of the fact that a Sri
              Lankan service provider is able to give us the advantage of a
              world class communication solution. Today’s media is driven by
              technology and hence we are committed to use all of the platforms
              that are available to improve our services to our clients. We can
              now link new head office and our new studios in Braybrooke Place
              to our studio in Depanama and to our main transmission tower in
              Union Place and our central transmission tower at Mount Oliphent.
              This solution provided by SLT will serve all seven of our media
              outlets. With this solution, I am very confident that our
              reliability factor will be improved.” <br><br>According to SLT, the fiber
              technology and data transmission system provided to MTV/MBC
              stations is the most advanced transmission technology currently
              available in the world. As there is no conversion of digital video
              signals to analog signals for transmission, ensuring optimum
              quality of the transmitted signal throughout. Resulting in an
              extremely good picture quality right through out their
              transmission.

          <p class="text" style="font-size: 18px">
            Sri Lankan television industry history will be created during the 10th South Asian Games as the Sri Lanka
            Rupavahini Corporation ties up Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) for live telecast of the 10th South Asian Games.
            Optical fiber based Synchronous Digital Interface technology (SDI) provided by SLT will be used for this
            historic transmission run both Worldwide and Island-wide. <span class="dots"> ...</span><br><br>
            <span class="moreText">

              SLRC has many firsts to its credit. This is the first time that a Sri Lankan Television station is going
              to
              be engaged in a live telecast with the aid of a “Fiber Optic Cable Link”. During the 10th South Asian
              Games
              Camera Video signals captured will be fed into specialized digital video transmission equipment setup at
              the
              games site. These signals will be then transmitted as digital signals via a Fiber Optic cable that links
              these specialized digital encoding equipment (at the stadium) to decoding equipment based at the SLRC
              studios, from which SLRC will carry out their special live telecast of the Games locally. SLT will also
              facilitate the international live transmission with microwave links and a special Satellite Uplink to the
              INSAT satellite from the Padduka Satellite Earth station. SLT’s expert engineers will be stand-by on site
              24
              X 7 during the games to ensure that the entire operation runs smoothly. <br><br>

              According to SLT the SDI (Synchronous Digital Interface) technology provided to SLRC for this telecast is
              the most advanced transmission technology currently available in the world. As the there is no conversion
              of
              digital video signals to analog signals for transmission, this technology ensures that the video-signals
              carried throughout the transmission are optimum quality possible. The end result being an extremely good
              picture quality right throughout this live transmission. This technology (although the first of its kind
              to
              be used in Sri Lanka) is standard application technology used by Major television networks in developed
              countries for live TV coverage of major global events. SLT has been in the forefront of introducing
              innovative state-of-the-art technologies to Sri Lanka to Bridge the Digital divide between Sri Lanka and
              the
              rest of the world. The Introduction and Application of SDI at these games is yet another attempt in
              fulfilling that corporate vision. <br><br>

              SLT is the Principal sponsor of the 10th South Asian Games which probably will go down in history as the
              most technologically sophisticated Sporting event held in Sri Lanka as at now. It was the first time a
              fully
              automated on-line real time player registration system was used for the games. Thirteen (13) distributed
              gaming sites are being connected through Wi-Max technology and each site is going to be Wi-Fi
              enabled/Wi-Fi
              Hotspots owing to the wireless technology backbone provided by SLT.
